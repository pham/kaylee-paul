    - We are gathered here in the sight of God and these witnesses to unite Paul and Kaylee in holy matrimony.
      As believers in Jesus Christ, they recognize that it was God who instituted marriage, and who said,
      "It is not good for man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."
      The God who made and redeemed them also instituted this relationship they are about to enter.
    - Paul and Kaylee, the vows you are about to take are not to be taken without careful thought and prayer.
      For in them, you are committing yourselves exclusively the one to the other for as long as you both shall live.
      This love is not to be diminished by difficult circumstances, and it is only to be dissolved by death.
    - As God's children by faith in Jesus Christ, the relationship of marriage is especially meaningful.
      Certainly it is possible for non-believers to marry,
      but only members of God's family by faith in Jesus Christ can ever experience the joy
      and fulfillment which God intends for marriage to have.
      Let me remind you, Paul and Kaylee, your home will never be what God intends for it to be if you leave Him out of your relationship.
      As you are obedient to the Word of God, and allow God to control your relationship,
      your home will be the place of joy and testimony to the world that God intends.

    - For as much as Paul and Kaylee have consented together in holy wedlock,
      and have witnessed the same before God and these witnesses,
      and thereto have pledged their faithfulness each to the other,
      and have pledged the same by the giving and receiving each of a ring,
      by the authority invested in me as a minister of the gospel according to the laws of the State of California,
      I pronounce that they are husband and wife together, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
    - Those that God has joined together, let no man put asunder.
